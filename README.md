# AI PPT Generator

An intelligent presentation generator that transforms documents and links into professional slides. It leverages AI API for high-quality content analysis and image generation.

## Background

Current PPT generation tools generally have the following issues:
1. After inputting generation requirements, they cannot strictly adhere to the constraints on the number of pages to be generated, nor do they have restrictions on content generation;
2. After generation, it is impossible to adjust the content of each page;
It is not possible to customize images for each page in a targeted manner.
3. Especially in enterprise and school reporting and presentation scenarios, current PPT generation tools are not very user-friendly.

Therefore, we have conceived the idea of developing a more suitable AI PPT Generator, especially for the aforementioned scenarios.

## Features

- **Multi-Format Upload**: Supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, and Images.
- **Link Analysis**: Can analyze content from provided URLs.
- **AI-Powered Outline**: Generates a structured presentation plan with key points and visual descriptions.
- **High-Quality Slide Images**: Creates visually stunning slide images based on the generated plan and your style preferences.
- **Customizable Styles**: Define your preferred visual style (e.g., Minimalist, Cyberpunk, Corporate).
- **Multi-Language Support**: Full interface and output support for English and Chinese (Simplified).
